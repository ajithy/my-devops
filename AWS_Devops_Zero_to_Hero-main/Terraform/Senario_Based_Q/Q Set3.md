# Terraform Scenario based Question

### 1. Your team uses Terraform to manage cloud infrastructure. One of your teammates accidentally deleted the .tfstate file from their local machine. How will you recover it, and how do you prevent this issue in the future?

### 2. You have been asked to create an infrastructure setup that multiple teams can reuse. How would you design a Terraform module to achieve this? Provide an example of how you’d structure the module and ensure it’s reusable.

### 3. You ran terraform apply, but it failed with an error stating that a specific resource already exists. How would you debug and resolve this issue while ensuring minimal manual intervention?

### 4. Your Terraform-managed AWS infrastructure has drifted from the configuration due to manual changes made by another team. How would you detect and fix this drift using Terraform?

### 5. Your Terraform execution time has significantly increased as your infrastructure grows. What optimizations can you implement to speed up terraform plan and terraform apply?

### 6. Your company needs to manage different environments (dev, staging, production) using Terraform. How would you structure your Terraform configuration to ensure each environment is properly managed and isolated?

### 7. Your team uses Terraform to deploy infrastructure on AWS. How would you ensure sensitive data like API keys, passwords, and database credentials are securely managed in Terraform?

### 8. Your organization wants to integrate Terraform into the CI/CD pipeline. How would you design an automated deployment pipeline that applies Terraform changes safely?

### 9. Multiple engineers are working on the same Terraform project. How does Terraform handle concurrency, and what precautions should be taken to prevent conflicts when applying changes? 

### 10. A recent Terraform deployment introduced a misconfiguration, causing downtime. How would you roll back to a previous stable state while maintaining state consistency?
