# What is swap space in Linux?
In Linux, swap space is a dedicated area on a storage device (usually a hard disk or SSD) that the operating system uses as virtual memory when physical RAM (Random Access Memory) is full. When the system runs out of available RAM, it moves less frequently used data from RAM to the swap space, allowing the system to continue running without crashing due to memory exhaustion. 


#  What is the purpose of the /etc/hosts file?
The "/etc/hosts" file is a plain text file used by operating systems like Unix and Linux to map hostnames to IP addresses locally. It serves as a local DNS (Domain Name System) resolver for the system, allowing users to define custom mappings of hostnames to IP addresses without relying on an external DNS server. This file is commonly used to override DNS resolution for specific domains or to define local hostnames for networked devices. It is often used for testing purposes, to set up local development environments, or to block access to certain websites by redirecting their domain names to localhost.

# How do you set a static IP address in Linux?
To set a static IP address in Linux, you typically need to modify the network configuration files. Here's a general guide on how to do it:

1. **Identify the Network Interface:** Determine which network interface you want to configure. You can use the `ifconfig` or `ip addr` command to list all network interfaces.

2. **Edit the Network Configuration File:** Depending on your Linux distribution, the network configuration file may vary. Commonly used ones include:
   - For systems using systemd (such as Ubuntu 16.04 and later, CentOS 7, etc.): Edit the configuration file under `/etc/netplan/`.
   - For systems using traditional network configuration (such as Ubuntu 14.04 and earlier, CentOS 6, etc.): Edit the configuration file under `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/`.

3. **Specify the Static IP Address:** Within the network configuration file, locate the configuration for your network interface (usually named something like `eth0`, `ens33`, etc.) and specify the static IP address, netmask, gateway, and DNS servers. For example:
   ```
   address 192.168.1.100
   netmask 255.255.255.0
   gateway 192.168.1.1
   dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
   ```

4. **Restart Networking Services:** After saving the changes, restart the networking service to apply the new configuration. Use commands like `sudo systemctl restart networking` or `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager` depending on your distribution.

5. **Verify Configuration:** Use commands like `ip addr show` or `ifconfig` to verify that the static IP address has been configured correctly.

6. **Test Connectivity:** Ensure that you can still access the network and the internet with the newly configured static IP address.

By following these steps, you can successfully set a static IP address in Linux.

# What are hard and soft limits in Linux?
***Soft limits***: Soft limits define the maximum resource usage allowed for a process or user. They can be adjusted by the user or the system administrator within certain predefined bounds. When a soft limit is reached, the system may issue a warning or send a signal to the process, depending on the specific resource being limited.

***Hard limits***: Hard limits are stricter than soft limits and cannot be exceeded by the user or process. They are set by the system administrator and act as an absolute cap on resource usage. If a process attempts to exceed a hard limit, the system typically terminates the process or denies the operation, depending on the nature of the resource being limited.

# What is the purpose of the /usr directory?
The purpose of the /usr directory is to provide a standardized location for installing and organizing software and files that are shared among multiple users on the system.

# diff between encoding and encryption
### Encoding:

- Encoding is the process of converting data from one format to another for the purpose of representing it in a more compact, standardized, or compatible form.
- Encoding does not involve securing the data or protecting it from unauthorized access. It is primarily used for data transmission, storage, and representation.
- Encoded data is typically reversible and can be decoded back to its original form using the appropriate decoding method.
- Examples of encoding include Base64 encoding, URL encoding, HTML encoding, and character set encodings like UTF-8.

### Encryption:

- Encryption is the process of converting data into a scrambled or unreadable form using an algorithm and a key. The purpose of encryption is to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data, ensuring that only authorized parties can access and decipher it.
- Encrypted data is transformed into ciphertext, which appears as random and meaningless characters without the decryption key.
- Encryption algorithms vary in complexity and security level, with modern encryption techniques using strong cryptographic algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman).
- Decryption is the process of reversing encryption to recover the original plaintext data using the decryption key.
- Encryption is commonly used to secure sensitive information during transmission over networks (e.g., HTTPS), storage on devices (e.g., encrypted hard drives), and communication between parties (e.g., end-to-end encryption in messaging apps).
